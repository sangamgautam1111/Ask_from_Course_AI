    "text": " Hello and welcome to the 5 minutes engineering Today's video is going to be very fun So, today finally, I have come to the center of the universe between the accuracy and the f1s Yes, yes, the commentary of this universe is the one I personally like You have to do it, just look at the last second video You have to sit down and take a look at the universe Just do something else and I am telling you what I am telling you Now, you will understand the things here You can come to this guarantee When you have seen this video before I have discussed the f1 score in very detailed So, first, look at the video once If you come here after seeing this This is the universe that is running This is a background, backstory, flashback You should know that you will not understand the universe Then you will not understand the universe It will be difficult to understand and you will understand it It will be difficult for both of you So, why to do difficult things? It is easy to make this happen So, let's start with the first thing The example we have considered from the beginning The data that is imbalanced I have discussed this in the previous video Where you will get the imbalanced data set It will be dangerous to see it No, no, no, no, no, no, it will not be possible This is not possible You will understand the imbalanced data If you watch the video My data set has a confusion of the accuracy It has four parameters in front of you So, you see I have 98 negative samples And two positive samples I mean, I have 100 samples in my data set In which I have 98 negative classes And the remaining two are positive classes You are understanding that you are extremely imbalanced data set This is with you It is not 50% of the data set This is not the case of the balanced data set This is an extreme imbalanced data set It is like that I have given you two examples The topic is T1, T2 I have just mentioned that you have to do 98 questions And two questions are done by T2 So, how is your preparation now? Now, to check the same Let's see how much accuracy you are preparing Because you are also a model You have to do 98 of the topic of T1 And two questions I want to see your preparation How are you going to solve these questions So, we are trying to help you But, you are not able to see the accuracy Now, we are going to learn the accuracy We will have to help you with the 4 parameters And you have to see this confusion matrix So, you have to see more than this confusion matrix This is my actual positive negative class This is the positive negative label However, you are right So, you have two positive negative classes Now, if you see this in the course of this This is Tp field It is true positive It is actually positive and it is also positive And one is positive And one is positive and one is positive And one is negative So, that is the mistake This is the error that you have encountered The second type is false positive type But, if you see here It is a big thing That you have given 98 questions You have given it to T1 topics You have solved all the questions very well That is, true negative It means that, even the actual negative Even the actual negative You have also predicted the same negative How much is 98? Your theory is very good You have to say that it is not a harsh And this is the accuracy that it says Because the formulation of the joules is Tp plus Tt And divided by Tt plus Tn plus fp plus fp That is, the simplest version I will say You have also predicted the correct correct predictions And the true predictions are divided by all the You know, samples that you have So, how much is the true? How much is 99? How much is it? Look, 98 plus true positive 1 That is 98 plus 1 is 99 So, 99 is divided by how much? 100 total samples are with us How much accuracy is there? 0.99 Now, you will be very happy to see accuracy And it is very good Is it the exam? But, it is the mistake that you have to make If you want to see the accuracy With this accuracy, you have to give this exam The exam will come in the test data If you believe If you have this class If you have a question of this topic So, how much accuracy is there on T2? Two questions are solved How much is it understood by the topic T2? Two questions are solved Yes, the T1 That is, the positive class is talking about this regard The 98 question is solved by the topic But, the question of T2 is not solved by the topic So, the question of T2 is not able to understand The bond between the concept of T2 is The information that is all is there It is not able to grasp So, will the answer of questions be given? Obviously, it is not the same But, if you have seen the accuracy This model is very good But, it is going to perform This accuracy is what you are saying So, this is the conflict To save it, we have F1 score It comes today Because, there is a conflict Because, the imbalance data set That is the bad part of the matter There is a problem that started And, you will see real life scenarios So, you will see the imbalance data sets But, this is a very extreme imbalance data set The imbalance data set that you have provided here But, from there, the way you get it Which you can tell the truth And, you know, you can inform your F1 score Because, this is considered by two parameters As I said in the previous video That is precision and recall So, precision and recall Harmonic means, you consider the mean And, that is what the F1 gives F1 score gives the value of So, how much precision is there? Precision is simple TEP divided by TEP plus FP So, how much is TEP? 1, FP, FP, 0 So, this is 0 So, 1 upon 1 It is a precision But, if you recall So, recall is the truth And, you will see the difference As I said in the TEP divide by TEP plus FN That is 1 upon 1 plus 1 What does it mean? What does TEP and FN mean? What does TEP1 mean? FN is 1 What does FN mean? What is the actual positive? How much is the positive? How much is the positive? How much is the positive? How much is the positive? How much is the positive? How much is the positive? 1 is not the positive 1 is the negative Now, what is the positive? So, that is 1 plus 1 is getting here And then, you can simply understand That, if you have 1 positive Then, how much is the positive? So, this is the positive here Now, let us consider both values And, let us compute the F1 score Which is the formula 2 into precision Recall is the precision So, 2 into 1 into Is it the reason to consider this? Because, it is the reason That is the reason That is the reason to consider this And, denominator is 2 here 3 by 2 So, 2 by 2 is 2 by 3 That is, 0.66 Your somewhere is somewhere F1 score is going to be gone So, this is the simple thing Look at the difference Look at the difference There is a difference here We are informing you That your respectively Like, model Is prepared in any way Or, you can perform it So, all these things You can clearly tell us That the difference is also Hopefully, you are trying to buy it You will understand the accuracy And, the F1 score is going to be understood In case of imbalance Data set, how is its performance Is its values going to be Information going to be understood So, please like this video And, share this video with your friends Thanks a lot And, thanks a lot for watching this video",
